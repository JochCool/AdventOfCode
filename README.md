# Advent of Code
> [!CAUTION]
> Beware of spoilers; this repository contains solutions to Advent of Code puzzles. I recommend you try to solve these by yourself first!

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. This repository includes all my solutions to those puzzles. I have participated in 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024 so far.

All my solutions are written in C#, using .NET with no external libraries. I write these all by myself, with only limited help from online sources if I am stuck. I do refactor them a bit after submitting my answer (so this repo doesn't have 100% "pure" solutions), and I have unit tests to ensure that they stay correct.
