# Advent of Code
> [!CAUTION]
> Beware of spoilers; this repository contains my solutions and the answers to Advent of Code puzzles.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. This repository includes all my solutions to those puzzles.

All my solutions are written in C#, using .NET with no external libraries. I do refactor them a bit after submitting my answer (so this repo doesn't have 100% "pure" solutions), and I have unit tests to ensure that they stay correct. I only push my solutions at the end of each day (provided I have solved it by then).
